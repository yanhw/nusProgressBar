"moduleDescription": "This is an interactive media design capstone module that explores \"user experience design\"(UXD), where main concern is design and evaluation of overall quality of the interactive experience a person has when interacting with a product or a system. Students will learn relevant theory and design techniques as well as engage in sustained design and evaluation activities. Concepts introduced include user-centric design, desirability, affordance (real and perceived), emotion design -- as well as related concepts and insights from psychology, computer science, semiotics, and marketing research. The module includes a studio component that involves semester-long design and evaluation of original prototype.",
